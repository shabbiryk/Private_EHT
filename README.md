# Private_EHT
An application that uses hyperledger fabric for managing Electronic Health Records (EHR) in a private permissioned blockchain.

Private_EHT aims to address the issue of data monopolization in the medical industry.
We aim to create a permissioned ledger using the blockchain technology to manage electronic health records. 
Despite the presence of research and papers on the topic, there are few real-world applications of this technology in action. 
By utilizing the Hyperledger fabric, we aim to create a system that can efficiently store and retrieve historical records while preventing data tampering.


However, the development process has not been without challenges, including difficulties with the development environment and compatibility issues.
 The main challenge was creating a decoupled architecture for the distributed application that includes patient and doctor login, state information, 
and OTP generation.
